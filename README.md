# Image Recognition
For this project, I've trained a model to recognize 32-by-32 pixels images provided in a folder. Even though it is an assisted project from a youtube tutorial, but i've gone a few steps further into the project and solved a major issue regarding saving and loading the model.<br>
And also I've implemented a new feature by which you can store all the images that you want to test on the model in a folder, and it will recognize the images one-by-one, before it was only limited to one image.
